            <strong>Beat the eggs: </strong>
            In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they
            are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a
            fluffier texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heat the pan: </strong>
            Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook the omelette: </strong>
            Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
            pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add fillings (optional): </strong>
            When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
            in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
            omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fold and serve: </strong>
            As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold
            it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it
            onto a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enjoy: </strong>
            Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
